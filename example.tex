\section{Technical Definitions}
A \deftech{technical definition} is a word or phrased with a technical use that
may differ from its common English use.
\Techs{technical definition} are introduced in italics, and later uses of a
\tech{technical definition} will link back to their definition.

\section{Tags}
A \deftech*{def}{tag} is associated with each \tech{technical definition}, and
used to create the link.
A \tech*{def}{tag} automatically computed from the \tech{technical definition},
but can also be manually supplied using the * form of each macro.

\lipsum
\section{Prefixes}
Each \tech{technical definition} also optionally takes a
\deftech*[prefix]{pref}{prefix} as an optional argument.
The current \tech*[prefix]{pref}{prefix} can also be supplied by redefining the
macro in \verb|\techprefix|.
This allows \tech{technical definitions} to be local to a section, chapter, or
other unit of text.
